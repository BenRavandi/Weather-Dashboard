# Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard

## Description

This weather dashboard application represents a real-world situation, in which the users are able to get the weather forecast for any city searched. The code has been built to help travelers to see the weather outlook for multiple cities so they can plan a trip accordingly. Users can check weather for current and the next five days based on the city that users wish to see. 

## Weather Dashboard Usage

- Users can clear up the page by clicking on Clear Search button as well
